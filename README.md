# OCR System with Contextual Actions

## Project Overview
This OCR system, developed in Python, uses Tesseract, OpenCV, and Tkinter to extract text from images. It performs contextual actions like translating, text-to-speech, and QR code detection, processing both static images and live webcam feeds.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**
- **Real-Time OCR from Webcam**
- **Text Translation & Speech**
- **Contextual Actions**
- **QR Code Detection**
- **Text Saving & Copying**

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnitLearner/Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-system.git
cd Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure Tesseract is installed and added to your system's PATH.

## Usage
Run the application:

```bash
python ocr_system.py
```

Select an image or start webcam OCR, and interact with the extracted text.
